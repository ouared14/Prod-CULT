### Gathering Data
* Put the multiplatform application (Desktop, Android & Web).
The figure provides a comprehensive overview of a data collection and management process tailored to cultural production. It highlights how various data
sources, including Weather Data, GIS/POI Sources, Google Engine, Data Collection, Soil Analysis Data/Region, and Incidents/Anomalies, are integrated and analyzed to
provide actionable insights.

### Conceptual workflow for merging data
The goal of the log merger is to create a merged log in a single format by combining a data log with an IT resource log and including
relevant attributes (i.e., features). Figure below shows the Conceptual workflow of the data merging process by collecting data logs from various sources
and parsing them into structured and unified dataset.
